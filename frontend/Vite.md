# VITE

Vite (pronounced "vit") is a bundler and dev server created by Evan You (the same creator of Vue.js). It replaces older tools like Webpack, Parcel, and Rollup in many cases.

It was designed to solve a problem that plagues modern projects: slow builds, long reloads, and complicated configurations.

## VITE PROJECT

```bash
# Create a project with Vite
npm create vite@latest

# Set the project name (or . for current folder), the framework and the variant

# Enter the folder and install the dependencies
cd meu-projeto
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
